Delay Monad
============

Specialization of the itree constructions to the delay monad implemented as an
indexed tree over the empty signature ∅ₑ.

From OGS Require Import Prelude.
From OGS.ITree Require Import Event ITree Structure.

The delay monad (Def 4.5) is formalized as an itree over
an empty signature: in the absence of events, [τ] and [ret] are the only constructors inhabited.

Relevant definitions can be found:
- for the underlying itree datatype, in [ITree/ITree.v]
- for the combinators, in [ITree/Structure.v].
- for the (strong/weak) bisimilarity, in [ITree/Eq.v].
- for guarded iteration (§ 6.2), in [ITree/Guarded.v]
