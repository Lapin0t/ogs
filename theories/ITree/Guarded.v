Guarded Iteration
==================

The [iterᵢ] combinator, adapted directly from the Interaction Tree library,
happily builds a computation [iter f] for any set of equations [f].
The resulting computation satisfies in particular an unfolding equation:
[iter f i ≈ f i >>= case_ (iter f) (ret)]
In general, this solution is however not unique, depriving us from a
powerful tool to prove the equivalence of two computations.

Through this file, we recover uniqueness by introducing an alternate
combinator [iter_guarded] restricted to so-called _guarded_ sets of equations:
they cannot be reduced to immediately returning a new index to iterate over.
Both combinators agree over guarded equations, but the new one satisfies
uniqueness.

Then, we refine the result to allow more sets of equations: not all must
be guarded, but they must always finitely lead to a guarded one.

(*|
A computation is __guarded__ if it is not reduced to [Ret (inl i)], i.e.
if as part of the loop, this specific iteration will be observable w.r.t.
strong bisimilarity.
It therefore may:
- end the iteration
- produce a silent step
- produce an external event
A set of equation is then said to be guarded if all its equations are guarded.

(*|
The [iterᵢ] combinator gets away with putting no restriction on the equations
by aggressively guarding with [Tau] all recursive calls.
In contrast, by assuming the equations are guarded, we do not need to introduce
any spurious guard: they are only legitimate in the case of returning immediately
a new index, which we can here rule out via [elim_guarded].

The absence of a spurious guard is reflected in the unfolding equation:
w.r.t. strong bisimilarity, it directly satisfies what one would expect,
i.e. we run the current equation, and either terminate or jump to the next

Eventually guarded iteration
------------------------------
For our purpose, proving the soundness of the ogs, guardedness is a bit too
restrictive: while not all equations are guarded, they all inductively lead
to a guarded one.
We capture this intuition via the notion of "eventually guarded" set of equations,
and establish similar result to ones in the guarded case.
