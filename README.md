# An abstract, certified account of operational game semantics

This development is a companion to the LICS'24 submission "An abstract, certified account of operational game semantics".
It has been rendered anonymous for the purpose of submission.

The main contribution of this library are:
- an independent implementation of an indexed counterpart to the itree library with support for guarded and eventually guarded recursion
- an abstract OGS model of an axiomatised language proven sound w.r.t. substitution equivalence
- several instantiations of this abstract result to concrete languages: typed and untyped cbv lambda calculus with fix, Downen and Ariola's polarized system D and system L.

## Building instructions

### Obtaining the project

```shell
git clone TODO
cd ogs
```

### Installing dependencies

We stress that the development has been only checked to compile against these specific dependencies.
In particular, it does not compiled at the moment against latest version of coq-coinduction due to major changes in the interface.

Installing the opam dependencies automatically:
```shell
opam install --deps-only .
```
or manually:
```shell
opam pin coq 8.17
opam pin coq-equations 1.3
opam pin coq-coinduction 1.6
```

### Building the project

```shell
dune build
```

### Axioms

The whole development relies only on axiom K, a conventional and sound axiom from Coq's standard library (more precisely, [Eqdep.Eq_rect_eq.eq_rect_eq]).
This can be double checked as follows:
- for the abstract result of soundness of the OGS by running [Print Assumptions ogs_correction.] at the end of [OGS/Soundness.v]
- for any particular example, for instance by running [Print Assumptions stlc_ciu_correct.] at the end of [Example/CBVTyped.v]

### Warning

The output of compilation is slightly cluttered with warnings: in particular when dealing with SProp, Equations fails to generate induction principles. Unfortunately, there is no convenient way to silence these warnings at the moment. They are naturally completely harmless w.r.t. to the formalization.
