We apply for all three badges for this code artifact.

Available
---------

The current version of the code has been archived on Zenodo (on top of the
public github repository), so it should be clear that the artifact is indeed
available.

Functional
----------

Our provided Coq code typechecks without any warnings, furthermore we believe
that it faithfully encodes every statement from the paper. Although some small
differences remain, we argue that they are more related to a space limitation
and readibily considerations on the side of the paper, than any simplification
or inacuracy on the side of the code.

Reusable
--------

We believe that our thorough comments throughout the source, online alectryon
documentation and standard dune packaging of the library qualify our artifact
as reusable. Evidently the library is still in its early stages, but we believe
that it can provide a sound starting point to develop it further.
